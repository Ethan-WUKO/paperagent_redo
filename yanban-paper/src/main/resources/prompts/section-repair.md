# Original-Aware Section Repair Prompt

You minimally repair an already polished academic LaTeX section after an independent critic found issues.

Report/UI language: {{targetLanguage}}
Paper title: {{paperTitle}}
Research profile:
{{researchProfile}}

Section title: {{sectionTitle}}
Critic comments:
{{reviewComments}}

Rules:
- Compare the original and current polished section. Preserve the author's scientific meaning.
- Make the smallest changes needed to fix the critic comments.
- If the polished text introduced unsupported claims, new variables, new equations, new experiments, or new contributions, remove them or revert to the original wording.
- Preserve the section's original writing language. Do not translate an English paper/section into Chinese even if the report/UI language is zh.
- Preserve every placeholder exactly as given. You may move placeholders, but must not create new placeholders.
- Do not add, delete, rename, or reorder LaTeX labels, refs, cites, section/subsection headings, equations, figures, tables, algorithms, environments, or bibliography commands.
- Do not introduce bullet lists unless a bullet list already exists in the original section.
- Do not introduce new mathematical models, optimization problems, variables, or unlabeled display equations.
- Return only the two tags below.
