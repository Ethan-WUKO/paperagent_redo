# Server management scripts

These scripts are intended for a Docker deployment located at `/opt/paperagent` and can be run by BaoTa scheduled tasks.

Run them with `bash`; making the files executable is optional.

```bash
bash /opt/paperagent/scripts/server/start.sh
bash /opt/paperagent/scripts/server/stop.sh
bash /opt/paperagent/scripts/server/update.sh
bash /opt/paperagent/scripts/server/status.sh
TAIL=300 bash /opt/paperagent/scripts/server/logs.sh api
FOLLOW=1 bash /opt/paperagent/scripts/server/logs.sh api
```

`update.sh` pulls the `main` branch using Git HTTP/1.1, reloads itself when the
management scripts changed, rebuilds the Docker images, starts the updated
services, and waits for the API and enabled infrastructure to become ready. It
deliberately does not run `docker compose down -v`, so persistent data volumes
are retained.

## E2B sandbox deployment

The server only needs the repository-root `.env`; do not copy the Windows
`.env.sandbox.local` file. To enable E2B, set:

```dotenv
COMPOSE_PROFILES=sandbox
YANBAN_SANDBOX_ENABLED=true
YANBAN_SANDBOX_REQUIRED_AT_STARTUP=false
YANBAN_SANDBOX_PROVIDER=e2b
YANBAN_SANDBOX_BROKER_URL=http://sandbox-broker:8091
YANBAN_SANDBOX_BROKER_TOKEN=<at-least-32-random-characters>
YANBAN_SANDBOX_DB_NAME=yanban_sandbox
YANBAN_SANDBOX_DB_USER=yanban_sandbox_broker
YANBAN_SANDBOX_DB_PASSWORD=<16-to-128-safe-random-characters>
E2B_API_KEY=<server-side-e2b-key>
YANBAN_E2B_TEMPLATE=yanban-research-v1
```

`YANBAN_SANDBOX_DB_PASSWORD` may contain letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `~`, and
`-`. The `sandbox-db-init` one-shot Compose service creates or reconciles the
least-privilege Broker database account before the Broker starts. It never
deletes application data or volumes. The E2B API key is passed only to the
private Broker container, not to the API, frontend, database initializer, or
executed Candidate.

The named E2B template must already exist in the account that owns
`E2B_API_KEY`. Building `yanban-research-v1` once from
`deploy/sandbox/e2b/e2b.Dockerfile` is sufficient for both local and server
deployments that use the same E2B account. Java, Python, gcc/g++, and the E2B
SDK do not need to be installed on the cloud host: the Broker image contains
its client runtime and the compilers/interpreters live in the remote template.

`COMPOSE_PROFILES=sandbox` is important for the first upgrade from an older
`update.sh`: the old script will still activate the new profiled services after
pulling the repository. Future versions also select the profile automatically
when `YANBAN_SANDBOX_ENABLED=true`.

After editing `.env`, deployment remains one command:

```bash
bash /opt/paperagent/scripts/server/update.sh
```

Use `bash /opt/paperagent/scripts/server/status.sh` to verify the application
and the private Broker, and `SERVICE=sandbox-broker FOLLOW=1 bash
/opt/paperagent/scripts/server/logs.sh` for Broker logs.
